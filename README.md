# CheckerGame
This was a simulation of a client-server checker game.
The purpose of this assignment was not so much to simulate a real checker game on a GUI board, but to show the networking between client and server.

To play, start the server. Then, start client 1. Finally start a third program for client two. The server should connect the two and prompt them in turn to enter their moves.
The game is over only when one client resigns or the two clients agree to draw.

The actual assignment description is below...

--------------------------------------
Due 2/5:

Create a client/server that will allow two people to play checkers.  As each player moves, the new state of the board should be communicated to the other player.  You may assume that both players only make legal moves, and the players will determine when the game ends.  A text-based interface is acceptable, just make it clear how a player enters a move.  You should come up with an appropriate application-layer protocol.
